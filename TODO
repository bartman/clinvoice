# About

This file just captures some TODO items.

# The list

* implement `cli add` command:

  - `cli add [ --on <datespec> ] <hours> [ <description> ]`
  
    adds a new entry under `<datespec>` (or today if not specified) for
    specified `<hours>`.  If `<description>` is not specified it opens
    `$EDITOR` to get one.

  - `cli add [+|-]<hours>`
  
    increments or decrements the last entry by given number of hours.


* implement `cli task` interface:

  - `cli task start <description>`
  
    starts a new task with given `<description>`.  The intent, and start time
    is stored in a temporary `.cli/task`.  There can only be one such task
    per project.

  - `cli task [ show ]`
  
    reports on current task.  Description, start time, duration.

  - `cli task end [ <hours> ]`
  
    ends the task adding the entry to the `.cli` file.  If `<hours>` is not
    given, it computes it from the start time.

  - should have some `.cliconfig` variable for rounding decisions.
    
    I personally like "round up to first hour, down to half hour after".
    Maybe that could be encoded in some "minimum task billing period" and
    "round down to" variable pair.
